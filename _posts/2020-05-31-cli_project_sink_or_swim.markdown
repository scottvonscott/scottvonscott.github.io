My first CLI project is finally complete, yet despite everything that I've learned, both techical and personal, I can't shake the feeling that I'm not finished yet. The process itself instilled the first real sense of how dynamic development can be. I've completed the assignment, but how do I know when the application is "done"?

First things first, my CLI is a trivia game called Trivium. It calls an API with several thousand questions from two dozen or so categories and lets users customize the kind of game they want to play. It keeps track of your scores between games to see if you're improving and prints incorrect questions/answers for you to take and learn about outside the game.

This was my first time working outside of the IDE. I unfortunately lost a bit of development time as I struggled to setup an environment locally, spun my wheels on how and where to start, and shouldered the onset intimidation of using github. Once I had successfully exited the cohort kiddle pool and shed the Flatiron floaties, I dove right in to writing my own methods and fleshing out my own ideas.

There's something very different about coding on your terms, you're setting the goalposts, taking the shots, and mixing the blog post metaphors like a madman. I found building the bones of the CLI to be pretty easy, but I later found that the improvements and expansions I would later write were more reactionary, rather than something I had conceived from the start. Finishing or polishing this part would reveal how that part was clumsy or basic. Would planning more ahead have prevented this or is it inevitable? Even now that calling it a "completed" CLI feels arbitrary. Does it work? Yes. Does it work well? For the most part. Is it a *good* CLI? Um, let me get back to you on that...

I imagine this feeling is pretty universal among coders, I hope so because that would be one more thing this project has done for me. For those of us who are new to coding, it's hard to not feel like outsiders and frauds. Tapping into into that development mindset and feeling like you belong just a little bit more, I might argue that's the most valuable takeaway.
