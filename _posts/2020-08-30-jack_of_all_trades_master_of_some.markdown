Somewhere, I promised myself that my first javascript project would simple, straighforward, and clean. You fool!

I dabbled a bit in JS prior to joining Flatiron, but after a few months or Ruby, it felt a little like I was starting over again. DOM manipulation was certainly foreign to me, as I also wasn't super comfortable with HTML, even after my Rails project. The small comfort I had moving forward this past week was that I am fairly confident while using Rails and with my understanding of how Rails would perform as an API for my Javascript application.

My single page app is called PartyMix, basically a party template creator that I figured would be beneficial to have, even if parties aren't super common these days anymore. Despite the name, there's nothing preventing it from being used as a "Night In" template creator! The underlying spirit of the app is that often times the most memorable times we share with friends are those that are truly unique, nights where an odd assortment of elements come together to make something special. Remember the time we ordered  Dim Sum, listened to that Beck album, and played Monopoly until 4 a.m.? You likely wouldn't make those specific plans if you sat down ahead of time with a pencil and paper, but that's exactly the kind of thing PartyMix is meant to encourage. 

As I mentioned, I wasn't too worried about the Rails backend working as an API. Shout out to "rails g scaffold"! I can see why it was so important we abstain from using it during the rails project, but I certainly appreicated it as it gave me more time to focus on Javascript.

Despite all of my promises to start small, build the MVP, and master the basics, I still somehow began with a huge, messy form with complicated params going to the backend. Lots of backpedalling, refactoring, and rethinking my approach slowed my advance into more sophisticated features, but I did ultimately pull off a dynamically sized form which ultimately created three or more objects in one go, which I'm proud of. As intimidating as JS has been, I was thankful to finally get to a more OO mindset and functionality has brought with it a familiarity and confidence that was sorely needed. 

It ain't much, but it works. I think that a big part of these early days is learning specifically what "YOU" can accomplish, and in how much time. Another week working on PartyMix would make the world of difference. Likewise, another week in JS will make the world of difference to me. It's important to remind youself how quickly we're moving, and keep in mind that our accomplishments are accumulating just as fast.
