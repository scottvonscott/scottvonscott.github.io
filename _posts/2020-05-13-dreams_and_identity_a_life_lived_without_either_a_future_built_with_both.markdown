I wish I could say that I’ve always dreamed of a career in software development, of a life working with computers and code, a dream where I knew who I was, what I wanted, and had a story that proved it. I wish I wasn’t so underwhelmed with the meager passions I’ve so far mustered towards being a new person. You probably wish for some damn levity in this blog post, and I don't blame you, sheesh.

Turns out I always had trouble figuring out what I was meant to do with myself, always second guessing what was worth doing, what was an attractive profession, what was an enviable life. Writing always clicked for me, it’s a great trick to convince people you’re more interesting than you are. I studied film and screenwriting, moved to Los Angeles, got a job at a screenwriting software company schmoozing professional writers and filmmakers. Not a bad spot to land in, so why am I so much more interested in what’s going on in engineering? It wasn’t such a wild stretch moving from one to the other. I like to create new things, obsess over details, fix things that don’t work, and always striving to improve. 

You almost feel this odd species of shame when you make a career change. You can feel like like you're giving up on what came before, giving up who you've been, either running to the next shiny thing, or away from the last with your tail between your legs.  I'm lucky enough to understand how one-dimensional that thinking is. Software development is a field I know will only allow me to better myself, and I lose nothing by embracing it. There’s always something new to learn with coding,  always challenges, and many, many rewarding possibilities. I'm happy I've chosen something that will allow me to grow so much.

I don’t think it matters if coding is a newfound passion or something scribbled with crayola colors since Scott immemorial. It’s the future I want, and I’ll let that alone define me.
